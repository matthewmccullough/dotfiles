# What is this?
These are Matthew McCullough's shell configuration dotfiles. The primary goal is to increase CLI productivity on Mac OSX, though many scripts run just fine on any POSIX implementation.

# Focus
The focus is on Zshell support, but there are plenty of cross-platform scripts in here. There are a few bash-specific ones.

# Inspirations
The contents of this repo have been partly invented from scratch, partly inspired by open source projects, and partly refactored from snippets from colleagues and friends. Many are attributed.
